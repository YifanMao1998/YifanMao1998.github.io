I am a first-year master student at Institute of Data and Information, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Prof. Xiu Li</a>.
Previously, I obtained my B.Eng in Software Engineering at School of Computer and Information Science & School of Software Engineering, Southwest University in 2024.

My research interests include **Low-level Vision**, **Medical Image Analysis** and **Camouflaged Object Segmentation**.
